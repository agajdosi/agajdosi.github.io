Presented as part of the &amp;lsquo;Good Job&amp;rsquo; exhibition, this artwork allows visiting artists to apply for financial assistance to cover expenses such as transportation, materials or fees that were not covered in their own art projects in the previous year.</description></item><item><title>Can We Help You?</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/exhibitions/group/can-we-help-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 17:26:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/exhibitions/group/can-we-help-you/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Minimal Wage</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/exhibitions/solo/minimal-wage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 17:26:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/exhibitions/solo/minimal-wage/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Cambridge Artalytica</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/thoughts/cambridge-artalytica/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 17:01:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/thoughts/cambridge-artalytica/</guid><description>When Cambridge Analytica&amp;rsquo;s marketing practices became public in the spring of 2018, everyone looked surprised. European and American lawmakers, leaders, entire governments were surprised. But did any of them or other experts really have no idea that the Facebook API existed, had never used it or at least read its documentation, and therefore could not have known that this leak, or rather just the use of the data, was something perfectly normal?</description></item><item><title>Truthify</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</guid><description>Truthify is a speculative video (7:38) about the eponymous startup that seeks to manipulate the perception of reality of future neural networks through the manipulation of open source datasets. Specifically, to map a dataset of images of Czech art under the general tag of art, with the aim of promoting Czech art as more detectable and known, and therefore as more arty than global art. Working with hyperbole and a slight ironic patriotism, the video exposes the serious topic of biased datasets and neural networks that have and will have impacts on our everyday lives.</description></item><item><title>Tauto</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/tauto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/tauto/</guid><description>Tauto is artistic software for activists and anybody else which allows to spread comments on Twitter. It is a command line tool to automate interactions of bot accounts on Twitter via Twitter&amp;rsquo;s graphical user interface (website in browser). Tauto is thus capable of interactions which are not available through Twitter API or which could be blocked if used in high volumes via API. Exploring the space of evil media it is a sarcastic comment on bot farms, but also a useful piece of software.</description></item><item><title>Nejsem Vas Procesor</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/thoughts/nejsem-vas-procesor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 17:02:18 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/thoughts/nejsem-vas-procesor/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Black Fly Day</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/black_fly_day/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/black_fly_day/</guid><description>Using industrial waste from material bank provided by PLATO I have created two boxes for cultivation of meat flies in the exhibition space. Grown-up flies were later released by me in two big shopping malls in the Ostrava city. Black Fly Day (2020) is an object/intervention created for the exhibition Sand in the Gears in gallery PLATO Ostrava.

Unlike normal psychological tests the Nejvyzkum.cz is not focused on testing its users - instead it uses crowdsourced prejudice of its users to test top 100 of Czech billionaires. The questions taken from Somatic Checklist 90 test and BigFive personality test are presented with random pairs of billionaires&amp;rsquo; faces to the visitors who then choose which one of the two most likely fits into the question.</description></item><item><title>Veřejně prospěšné umělecké práce / Community Art Service</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/community_art_service/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/community_art_service/</guid><description>In order to explore the meaning of art in times of pandemic and war, I decided to be radically useful. Wearing a work suit with the inscription &amp;ldquo;Community Art Service&amp;rdquo;, I cleaned up the city of Pardubice for a month. Freed from the pressure of assignments, demands and supervision of a traditional employer, as a free worker I let myself be openly guided and dérived by the situations, people and streets of an unknown city.</description></item><item><title>Rtutík / Mercurie</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mercurie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mercurie/</guid><description>In 2019 the Regional Office in Pardubice approved emission exception for Chvaletice power plant. The exeption allowed the power plant to emit 300 kilograms of mercury over the normal emission limit. During the action days of czech Climate Camp 2019 I have realized a protest performance in the streets of Pardubice. Covered in thermofoil I have played huge droplet of mercury flowing through the city and spreading the word about beauties of mercury.</description></item><item><title>Unhuman Resources</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/unhuman_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/unhuman_resources/</guid><description>Unhuman Resources is online media intervention thematizing the power of Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš over news servers link:https://idnes.cz[idnes.cz] and link:https://lidovky.cz[lidovky.cz] which he both owns. It consists of two fake web pages link:https://l-dnes.cz[l-dnes.cz] and link:https://1idovky.cz[1idovky.cz] (later link:https://lidov.ky[lidov.ky]) which mocks their original versions by altering the text of every article. In these edits which appears on every mention of Babis&amp;rsquo;s name, his political party ANO, or just randomly at the ends of paragraphs, the (fictional) toxic relationship of owner and employee is slowly revealed.</description></item><item><title>Conclusions of Police Investigation</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/conclusions_of_police_investigation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/conclusions_of_police_investigation/</guid><description>Conclusions of Police Investigation is a site-specific video created for exhibition at gallery Umakart. In the video two persons are playing a board game Unusual Suspects. In this game one person is the witness to a crime. He knows who the culprit is but can only answer “Yes” or “No” to questions about the suspect. The second person is a detective trying to make sure the right person gets locked up from a line up of twelve hand drawn suspects.</description></item><item><title>Mailbox for Feedback</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mailbox_for_feedback/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mailbox_for_feedback/</guid><description>I have installed a mailbox on stairs near main classrooms of Faculty of Fine Arts in Brno. It asks employees, students and visitors to write down their ideas on what is and what is not working well on the faculty. Even though the mailbox was installed as a guerilla act the text on it used official language and looked like it was realized by the faculty. Later I have sent to the Dean a letter containg keys for the mailbox and also stating: ‘I thought it could be useful, so I did it.</description></item><item><title>Nomin</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/nomin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/nomin/</guid><description>Nomin (2017-2018) is project in progress on the edge of software, institutional critique and collective performance. Its main goal is to help artists from weakened social groups (students, pregnant artists, those who live outside big centers, easterners) with acceleration of their careers.
For this purpose I have created an open source GUI application for Linux, Mac and Windows called Nomin which provides its users the ability of sending fake emails from addresses of famous curators to the mailboxes of selected galleries or other institutions.</description></item><item><title>Take Away</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</guid><description>Take Away (2017) is a gallery project which consisted of 330 criminal complaints for incitement of hatred. Criminal complaints were automatically generated with all needed legal reasoning and filled with names and actual citations of users who aggressively commented on anti-islamic or other far-right Facebook pages. The visitors could freely search and read through the complaints and take whichever they want, however they were not directly asked in any way to submit them.</description></item><item><title>Mail from mr.

The mail looked like if it was from Vice-Dean for student affairs Pavel Ondracka: it has his email address in the header, used his style of language and welcomed all students in new building of FFA.
However it also announced several changes in the organozation of the study and faculty.</description></item><item><title>Sauna / What Dean Promised I am Doing</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/sauna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/sauna/</guid><description>As part of pre-election promises for both terms the current dean of Faculty of Fine Arts promised a school sauna for students and employees of faculty. However this populist promise was never realized. To react I took his promise seriously and tried my best… Sauna was operating from January 2017 to March 2017, freely open to all students, employees and visitors of faculty.</description></item><item><title>NarodniLiga.cz</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/narodni_liga/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/narodni_liga/</guid><description>Narodniliga.cz/NationalLeague.cz (2016) is a fake web of czech anti-islamic movement. It gathers data from Facebook groups which are focused against refugees and islam and makes daily, weekly and monthly rankings. Those who were commenting most are then winners of the league.
However what on on first sight looks like a classic right wing web page - colored with tricolora - later gives unpleasant image of czech anti-islamic movement. The page is full of real comments whose authors sends other people to gas, who wish them drowning in sea, full of vulgarisms etc.</description></item><item><title>Rumours to MIDI</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/rumours_to_midi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/rumours_to_midi/</guid><description>Rumours to MIDI (2015) is a custom program written in Python.

The photographs do not only refer working author or his graphical card on visual basis but also on capitalist level: earned money were used for printing of the actual pictures. Thus the more earning work, the bigger photography.</description></item><item><title>The Raft of the Frogman</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/raft_of_the_frogman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2014 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/raft_of_the_frogman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Dusk /Simulation 1/</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/dusk/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/dusk/</guid><description>Dusk /Simulation 1/ is a video of shopping mall interior from which were removed all moving objects.
