The work satirically responds to the double standard of Czech foreign policy by giving users no choice, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights and the international law of war, to label both bombings as bad.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Suspects</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/artificial_suspects/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 16:01:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/artificial_suspects/</guid><description>The artificial intelligence model in the learning process condenses not only knowledge but also biases. And not only those contained in the quality of the dataset itself (from whom, for whom, why?), but also in the deeper layers of human culture. The result is the ability of AI models not only to generate but also to reduce.
In the case of GPT4o, this is the ability to represent text/words in the form of 3072 numerical parameters.</description></item><item><title>Crisis Fund</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/crisis_fund/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/crisis_fund/</guid><description>&amp;lsquo;Crisis Fund&amp;rsquo;, in the authorial duo with Jonas Svoboda, is an artwork consisting in minimizing the costs of creating the work and transferring the exhibition budget for the realization of the work to other artists. Presented as part of the &amp;lsquo;Good Job&amp;rsquo; exhibition, this artwork allows visiting artists to apply for financial assistance to cover expenses such as transportation, materials or fees that were not covered in their own art projects in the previous year.</description></item><item><title>The Raft of the Frogman</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/raft_of_the_frogman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/raft_of_the_frogman/</guid><description>Performance as an interface between IT worker, frog in a pot, grotesque and ecological tragedy.
I created a floating monument of recycling out of waste plastic containers for motor oil as a solution for unlimited production. Dressed in normcore clothing, I then took to the water to celebrate the triumph of man over the impact of man with three victorious frog leaps. Then it got ugly.
Vacation on a warming lake turned into a nightmare for the unaware ICT worker, Mr Froggie (1-99).</description></item><item><title>Konec Vlády Autostrády / The End of the Motorway Rule</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/konec_vlady_autostrady/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2023 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/konec_vlady_autostrady/</guid><description>A series of posters in support of the &amp;ldquo;Thirty for Prague&amp;rdquo; movement to limit the speed limit to 30km/h in Prague. The parody series depicts the Mayor of Prague Bohuslav Svoboda, who is a big fan of car traffic, in the style of socialist realism. On the posters Svoboda is depicted as a communist dictator standing in front of crowds of cars.
In this artwork Prague&amp;rsquo;s main road &amp;ldquo;Magistrála&amp;rdquo;, a de facto highway stretching through the city centre, served me as the link between the current right-wing and the communist regime.</description></item><item><title>Caravanitas</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/caravanitas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/caravanitas/</guid><description>Caravanitas (2023), a series of tourist postcards created for the city of Le Mans, combines the vanitas genre with the interiors and exteriors of contemporary cars through the technique of 3D rendering manipulated by artificial intelligence. It is a meditation on the impermanence not only of the individual but also of entire ecosystems in the context of the climate crisis and the city made famous by the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race.</description></item><item><title>Veřejně prospěšné umělecké práce / Community Art Service</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/community_art_service/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/community_art_service/</guid><description>In order to explore the meaning of art in times of pandemic and war, I decided to be radically useful. Wearing a work suit with the inscription &amp;ldquo;Community Art Service&amp;rdquo;, I cleaned up the city of Pardubice for a month. Freed from the pressure of assignments, demands and supervision of a traditional employer, as a free worker I let myself be openly guided and dérived by the situations, people and streets of an unknown city.</description></item><item><title>Cambridge Artalytica</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/blog/cambridge-artalytica/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 17:01:30 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/blog/cambridge-artalytica/</guid><description>When Cambridge Analytica&amp;rsquo;s marketing practices became public in the spring of 2018, everyone looked surprised. European and American lawmakers, leaders, entire governments were surprised. But did any of them or other experts really have no idea that the Facebook API existed, had never used it or at least read its documentation, and therefore could not have known that this leak, or rather just the use of the data, was something perfectly normal?</description></item><item><title>Truthify</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</guid><description>Truthify, in collaboration with Vilem Duha and Petr Racek, is a speculative video (7:38) about the eponymous startup that seeks to manipulate the perception of reality of future neural networks through the manipulation of open source datasets. Specifically, to map a dataset of images of Czech art under the general tag of art, with the aim of promoting Czech art as more detectable and known, and therefore as more arty than global art.</description></item><item><title>Tauto</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/tauto/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/tauto/</guid><description>Tauto is artistic software for activists and anybody else which allows to spread comments on Twitter. It is a command line tool to automate interactions of bot accounts on Twitter via Twitter&amp;rsquo;s graphical user interface (website in browser). Tauto is thus capable of interactions which are not available through Twitter API or which could be blocked if used in high volumes via API. Exploring the space of evil media it is a sarcastic comment on bot farms, but also a useful piece of software.</description></item><item><title>Black Fly Day</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/black_fly_day/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/black_fly_day/</guid><description>Using industrial waste from material bank provided by PLATO I have created two boxes for cultivation of meat flies in the exhibition space.

Unlike normal psychological tests the Nejvyzkum.cz is not focused on testing its users - instead it uses crowdsourced prejudice of its users to test top 100 of Czech billionaires. The questions taken from Somatic Checklist 90 test and BigFive personality test are presented with random pairs of billionaires&amp;rsquo; faces to the visitors who then choose which one of the two most likely fits into the question.</description></item><item><title>Power Play</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/power_play/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Mar 2020 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/power_play/</guid><description>Performance as a dreamy power play. I&amp;rsquo;ve imagined an alternative world where there is a socially engaged and non-xenophobic hockey fan.
Wearing the jersey and merchandise of the Kometa hockey club, I protested against the election of the racist and antisocial Stanislav Kreck as ombudsman of the Czech Republic. After the publication of the report in the media, there followed several mass patrol actions of the fanclub after the degenerate fan among them.</description></item><item><title>Rtutík / Mercurie</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mercurie/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mercurie/</guid><description>In 2019 the Regional Office in Pardubice approved emission exception for Chvaletice power plant. The exeption allowed the power plant to emit 300 kilograms of mercury over the normal emission limit. During the action days of czech Climate Camp 2019 I have realized a protest performance in the streets of Pardubice. Covered in thermofoil I have played huge droplet of mercury flowing through the city and spreading the word about beauties of mercury.</description></item><item><title>Unhuman Resources</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/unhuman_resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/unhuman_resources/</guid><description>Unhuman Resources is online media intervention thematizing the power of Czech prime minister Andrej Babiš over news servers link:https://idnes.cz[idnes.cz] and link:https://lidovky.cz[lidovky.cz] which he both owns. It consists of two fake web pages link:https://l-dnes.cz[l-dnes.cz] and link:https://1idovky.cz[1idovky.cz] (later link:https://lidov.ky[lidov.ky]) which mocks their original versions by altering the text of every article. In these edits which appears on every mention of Babis&amp;rsquo;s name, his political party ANO, or just randomly at the ends of paragraphs, the (fictional) toxic relationship of owner and employee is slowly revealed.</description></item><item><title>Conclusions of Police Investigation</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/conclusions_of_police_investigation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/conclusions_of_police_investigation/</guid><description>Conclusions of Police Investigation is a site-specific video created for exhibition at gallery Umakart. In the video two persons are playing a board game Unusual Suspects. In this game one person is the witness to a crime. He knows who the culprit is but can only answer “Yes” or “No” to questions about the suspect. The second person is a detective trying to make sure the right person gets locked up from a line up of twelve hand drawn suspects.</description></item><item><title>Mailbox for Feedback</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mailbox_for_feedback/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/mailbox_for_feedback/</guid><description>I have installed a mailbox on stairs near main classrooms of Faculty of Fine Arts in Brno. It asks employees, students and visitors to write down their ideas on what is and what is not working well on the faculty. Even though the mailbox was installed as a guerilla act the text on it used official language and looked like it was realized by the faculty. Later I have sent to the Dean a letter containg keys for the mailbox and also stating: ‘I thought it could be useful, so I did it.</description></item><item><title>Nomin</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/nomin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Mar 2018 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/nomin/</guid><description>Nomin (2017-2018) is project in progress on the edge of software, institutional critique and collective performance. Its main goal is to help artists from weakened social groups (students, pregnant artists, those who live outside big centers, easterners) with acceleration of their careers.
For this purpose I have created an open source GUI application for Linux, Mac and Windows called Nomin which provides its users the ability of sending fake emails from addresses of famous curators to the mailboxes of selected galleries or other institutions.</description></item><item><title>Take Away</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</guid><description>Take Away (2017) is a gallery project which consisted of 330 criminal complaints for incitement of hatred.

The visitors could freely search and read through the complaints and take whichever they want, however they were not directly asked in any way to submit them.</description></item><item><title>Mail from mr.

The mail looked like if it was from Vice-Dean for student affairs Pavel Ondracka: it has his email address in the header, used his style of language and welcomed all students in new building of FFA.
However it also announced several changes in the organozation of the study and faculty.</description></item><item><title>Sauna / What Dean Promised I am Doing</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/sauna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/sauna/</guid><description>As part of pre-election promises for both terms the current dean of Faculty of Fine Arts promised a school sauna for students and employees of faculty.

It gathers data from Facebook groups which are focused against refugees and islam and makes daily, weekly and monthly rankings. Those who were commenting most are then winners of the league.
However what on on first sight looks like a classic right wing web page - colored with tricolora - later gives unpleasant image of czech anti-islamic movement. The page is full of real comments whose authors sends other people to gas, who wish them drowning in sea, full of vulgarisms etc.</description></item><item><title>Rumours to MIDI</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/rumours_to_midi/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/rumours_to_midi/</guid><description>Rumours to MIDI (2015) is a custom program written in Python.
