And not only those contained in the quality of the dataset itself (from whom, for whom, why?), but also in the deeper layers of human culture. The result is the ability of AI models not only to generate but also to reduce.

In the video two persons are playing a board game Unusual Suspects. In this game one person is the witness to a crime. He knows who the culprit is but can only answer “Yes” or “No” to questions about the suspect. The second person is a detective trying to make sure the right person gets locked up from a line up of twelve hand drawn suspects.</description></item></channel></rss>
