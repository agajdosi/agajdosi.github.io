Criminal complaints were automatically generated with all needed legal reasoning and filled with names and actual citations of users who aggressively commented on anti-islamic or other far-right Facebook pages. The visitors could freely search and read through the complaints and take whichever they want, however they were not directly asked in any way to submit them.</description></item><item><title>Mail from mr.

The mail looked like if it was from Vice-Dean for student affairs Pavel Ondracka: it has his email address in the header, used his style of language and welcomed all students in new building of FFA.
However it also announced several changes in the organozation of the study and faculty.</description></item></channel></rss>
