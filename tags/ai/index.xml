And not only those contained in the quality of the dataset itself (from whom, for whom, why?), but also in the deeper layers of human culture. The result is the ability of AI models not only to generate but also to reduce.
In the case of GPT4o, this is the ability to represent text/words in the form of 3072 numerical parameters.</description></item><item><title>Caravanitas</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/caravanitas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/caravanitas/</guid><description>Caravanitas (2023), a series of tourist postcards created for the city of Le Mans, combines the vanitas genre with the interiors and exteriors of contemporary cars through the technique of 3D rendering manipulated by artificial intelligence. It is a meditation on the impermanence not only of the individual but also of entire ecosystems in the context of the climate crisis and the city made famous by the 24 Hours of Le Mans car race.</description></item><item><title>Truthify</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/truthify/</guid><description>Truthify, in collaboration with Vilem Duha and Petr Racek, is a speculative video (7:38) about the eponymous startup that seeks to manipulate the perception of reality of future neural networks through the manipulation of open source datasets. Specifically, to map a dataset of images of Czech art under the general tag of art, with the aim of promoting Czech art as more detectable and known, and therefore as more arty than global art.</description></item></channel></rss>
