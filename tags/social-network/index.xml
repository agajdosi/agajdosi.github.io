It is a command line tool to automate interactions of bot accounts on Twitter via Twitter&amp;rsquo;s graphical user interface (website in browser). Tauto is thus capable of interactions which are not available through Twitter API or which could be blocked if used in high volumes via API. Exploring the space of evil media it is a sarcastic comment on bot farms, but also a useful piece of software.</description></item><item><title>Take Away</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 May 2017 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/take_away/</guid><description>Take Away (2017) is a gallery project which consisted of 330 criminal complaints for incitement of hatred. Criminal complaints were automatically generated with all needed legal reasoning and filled with names and actual citations of users who aggressively commented on anti-islamic or other far-right Facebook pages. The visitors could freely search and read through the complaints and take whichever they want, however they were not directly asked in any way to submit them.</description></item><item><title>NarodniLiga.cz</title><link>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/narodni_liga/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 16:05:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://gajdosik.org/artworks/narodni_liga/</guid><description>Narodniliga.cz/NationalLeague.cz (2016) is a fake web of czech anti-islamic movement. It gathers data from Facebook groups which are focused against refugees and islam and makes daily, weekly and monthly rankings. Those who were commenting most are then winners of the league.
However what on on first sight looks like a classic right wing web page - colored with tricolora - later gives unpleasant image of czech anti-islamic movement. The page is full of real comments whose authors sends other people to gas, who wish them drowning in sea, full of vulgarisms etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
