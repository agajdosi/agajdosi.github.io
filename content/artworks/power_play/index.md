Performance as a dreamy power play.
I've imagined an alternative world where there is a socially engaged and non-xenophobic hockey fan. 

Wearing the jersey and merchandise of the Kometa hockey club, I protested against the election of the racist and antisocial Stanislav Kreck as ombudsman of the Czech Republic.
After the publication of the report in the media, there followed several mass patrol actions of the fanclub after the degenerate fan among them.
