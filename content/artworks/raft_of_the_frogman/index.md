Performance as an interface between IT worker, frog in a pot, grotesque and ecological tragedy.

I created a floating monument of recycling out of waste plastic containers for motor oil as a solution for unlimited production.
Dressed in normcore clothing, I then took to the water to celebrate the triumph of man over the impact of man with three victorious frog leaps.
Then it got ugly.

Vacation on a warming lake turned into a nightmare for the unaware ICT worker, Mr Froggie (1-99).
