Using industrial waste from material bank provided by PLATO I have created two boxes for cultivation of meat flies in the exhibition space.
Grown-up flies were later released by me in two big shopping malls in the Ostrava city.
Black Fly Day (2020) is an object/intervention created for the exhibition Sand in the Gears in gallery PLATO Ostrava.
