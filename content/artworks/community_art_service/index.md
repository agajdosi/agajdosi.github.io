In order to explore the meaning of art in times of pandemic and war, I decided to be radically useful.
Wearing a work suit with the inscription "Community Art Service", I cleaned up the city of Pardubice for a month.
Freed from the pressure of assignments, demands and supervision of a traditional employer, as a free worker I let myself be openly guided and dérived by the situations, people and streets of an unknown city.
In doing so, I focused on cleaning up overlooked places: river banks, socially excluded localities and statues in public space.
